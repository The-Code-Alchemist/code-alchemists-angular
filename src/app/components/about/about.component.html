  <h2>The Story Behind Code Alchemists: The Mission</h2>
  <h3>Combining the Mindset of Two Disciplines: Clean Code and Alchemy</h3>

  <p>✓ The <strong>Code</strong> part focuses on maintainable clean code. <em>Clean Code</em> is a book written by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) that defines this topic extensively.</p>
  <p>An overview of Uncle Bob's books can be found <a href="https://cleancoder.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

  <p>The Software Improvement Group describes 10 guidelines for building maintainable software.</p>
  <p>The book is available for free: <a href="https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/publications/ebook-building-maintainable-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building Maintainable Software</a></p>

  <p>✓ The <strong>Alchemists</strong> part refers to alchemy (<em>al-kimia</em> in Arabic), an ancient proto-science that paved the way for modern science and chemistry in particular.</p>

  <p>The goal of Western alchemists was to transform base metals (such as iron, nickel, copper, and lead) into precious metals like silver or gold.</p>
  <p>In contrast, curing diseases was the most important goal of Eastern (oriental) alchemists.</p>

  <p>✓ To top it off, we blend software craftsmanship with <a href="https://www.sixsigmacouncil.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lean</a> principles and team agility.</p>
